# Public-facing status

Last updated: 2026-09-17

RhymeLab's public repository is `Graph1ks/rhymelab`. `main` is protected and the required public CI check is `validate`.

## Current product/runtime baseline — v0.11.0

The normal local UI/API now uses the accepted materialized German Writer runtime by default:

```text
package               v0.11.0
writer DB             data/local/rhymelab-v5.sqlite
writer DB schema      rhymelab-local-db-v5
writer runtime        materialized-writer-v5-v1
writer ranking        deterministic_writer_utility_v6
right-edge anchor     de-right-edge-anchors-v1
anchor storage        compact-primary-key-v2
candidate basis       legacy-vowel-key-string-suffix-v1
morphology            de-attested-right-head-v4
construction          de-adverbial-weise-v2
morphology storage    positive-evidence-compact-v2
```

`npm run dev` uses this Writer v5 path.

## Legacy/control baseline — preserved

The previous v0.10.0 / DB-v4 runtime remains the protected regression/control path only:

```text
control DB            data/local/rhymelab.sqlite
control DB schema     rhymelab-local-db-v4
analyzer              de-ipa-v2
scorer                de-phon-v3
relation              rhyme-relations-v2
ranking               modern_entity_relative_commonness_1decade_0_05
request               ?ranking=legacy
```

The v4 DB is optional for normal v0.11 Writer use. If it is absent, the normal Writer UI still starts; only explicit `?ranking=legacy` requests are unavailable.

## German single-word Writer — ACCEPTED / PROMOTED

Acceptance document: `docs/WRITER_SEARCH_ACCEPTANCE.md`.

Protected behavior remains:

- `Arbeitsweise -> Hochzeitsreise`: retrieval sentinel only, rank 116;
- `Arbeitsweise -> right:reise`: `Weiterreise` rank 3;
- `Liebe -> Diebe`: rank 1;
- `Leben -> neben`: rank 2;
- `Nacht -> macht`: rank 1;
- all 10 productive-`-weise` / false-split morphology regressions pass.

Writer v7 remains rejected and rolled back. Material changes to the frozen single-word Writer policies require a new benchmarked candidate.

## Human Writer NDCG policy

Writer Page NDCG@10/20 remains `pending_reference` by explicit project decision.

It will not be collected from the project owner alone. Independent human usefulness evaluation is deferred until the broader German Writer system — including phrase/mosaic/phraseology — is mature enough to evaluate coherently and independent reviewers are available.

## Current phase — Phase 11 German phrase / mosaic / phraseology

Execution plan: `docs/PHRASE_MOSAIC_PLAN.md`.

Immediate next gate is **11A public-source survey**. Before implementing a phrase database/runtime, research candidate public German sources for multi-word phrases, n-grams/collocations, idioms/Redewendungen, formulaic expressions/proverbs, metaphorical/figurative expressions, useful sentence fragments, and deterministic semantic discovery resources.

For each serious source record bulk/reproducible access, license, redistribution/commercial compatibility, snapshot/version, scale/raw format, phrase coverage, provenance identifiers, and fully offline post-ingestion viability.

OpenThesaurus and OdeNet are possible semantic ingredients, not assumed complete phraseology sources.

English remains deferred until the German phrase/mosaic path is stable enough to freeze.
